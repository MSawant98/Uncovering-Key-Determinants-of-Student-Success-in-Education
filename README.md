Uncovering Key Determinants of Student Success in Education

Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/desalegngeb/students-exam-scores/data
Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information on students' demographic, socioeconomic, and academic backgrounds aimed at understanding factors influencing their performance. It includes 14 variables such as gender, ethnic group, parental education, and marital status, along with study habits like weekly study hours and test preparation status. Additionally, it records students' engagement in extracurricular activities (e.g., sports), the number of siblings, and means of transport to school. The dataset also captures three key academic performance metrics: MathScore, ReadingScore, and WritingScore, ranging from 0 to 100. This diverse set of attributes provides a comprehensive view for analyzing how various factors contribute to student success.

Project Questions
1. Company/Industry you are working on and why:
The dataset focuses on the education industry, specifically analyzing factors influencing students' academic performance. This industry is pivotal because understanding the determinants of student success can help improve educational outcomes, allowing schools to provide better support and resources to students.
2. How did you find the dataset:
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and is designed to capture various socio-demographic and academic performance factors of students.. It includes information like gender, parental education, and weekly study hours, which are crucial for understanding the influences on students' academic performance.
3. What specific marketing problem you are researching on and why:
The specific problem being researched is identifying the factors that most significantly impact students' performance in math, reading, and writing. This is crucial because schools and educational services can tailor their programs and interventions to focus on the areas that most influence academic success, thereby improving overall student performance.
4. How will you go about solving the problem:
To solve this problem, I will conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between different factors like parental education, test preparation, weekly study hours, and students' scores. Statistical methods and visualizations will be used to highlight key insights, followed by building predictive models to assess the impact of each variable on academic performance.
5. What do you hope to accomplish with the project:
The goal of the project is to uncover actionable insights that can be used by educational institutions to improve student support programs. By identifying which factors most strongly correlate with high academic performance, schools can better allocate resources and design initiatives that promote better outcomes for their students.
